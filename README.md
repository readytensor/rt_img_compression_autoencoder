# Autoencoder for Image Compression: An Educational Tutorial
## Project Overview
This repository contains an educational tutorial on implementing autoencoders using PyTorch, focusing on image compression. The project uses the MNIST dataset to demonstrate the principles of autoencoders, including how they can be used for compressing and decompressing images.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the concept and architecture of autoencoders.
- Explore image compression and decompression using autoencoders.
- Experiment with different compression ratios and analyze the impact on image quality.
Installation
To get started, clone this repository and install the required packages in **`requirements.txt`**:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Tutorial Outline
The `auto_encoder.ipynb` notebook walks through the following steps:

- Data Preparation: Loading and preprocessing the MNIST dataset.
- Model Building: Defining the autoencoder architecture.
- Model Training: Training the model to learn efficient data encoding.
- Compression and Decompression: Demonstrating how to compress and decompress images.
- Visualization: Comparing original, compressed, and decompressed images.

## Example Outputs
The tutorial includes visual examples of original, compressed, and decompressed images at various compression ratios to illustrate the effectiveness of the trained autoencoder.
